## SciFig Learning Outcomes for Users

Learning outcomes for using this repository:
- Participants will learn how to critically review their figures using the provided spectrum of figure development and a figure evaluation rubric.
- Participants will understand what resources are available to help with figure construction.
- Participants will understand differences and key components between creating figures for publications, presentations (including Thesis Advisory Committee meetings), and posters. 


## Overview of Workshop Items and Handouts

This workshop will include several items and documents for you to use in your figure-making journey. In this repo, we will provide you with the following tools
- [Spectrum of Figure Creation](https://github.com/nrokh/ScientificFigures/blob/main/README.md#spectrum-of-figure-creation)
- [Figure Assessment Rubric](https://github.com/nrokh/ScientificFigures/blob/main/README.md#figure-assessment-rubric)
- [SciFigs Helpful Links and FAQs](https://github.com/nrokh/ScientificFigures/blob/main/README.md#quick-links-and-faqs-)
- [Inkscape 101](https://github.com/nrokh/ScientificFigures/blob/main/README.md#inkscape-101-)
- Running your own workshop (coming soon...)



<h2 align="center">Spectrum of Figure Creation</h2>

<details>
	
The spectrum contains multiple figures to help scientists understand the iterative process for creating scientific visualizations. The figures are arranged in the following order:
- Spectrum of Figure Creation
	- Figure 1: The worst figure you (hopefully) will ever see. Nobody ever needs to see another figure like this one. 
	- Figure 2: The same data and the same plot type from Figure 1 are now reworked into a more professional version. 
	- Figure 3: After careful consideration of the _data_, this figure combines the two subplots from Figure 2 to create a comprehensive and easy-to-interpret view.
	- Figure 4: After careful consideration of the _plot type_, this series of figures represents the data using a plot type that matches the data type. 
		- Figure 4a: This is a figure that would be appropriate for a publication, where the reader has lots of time to engage, think, and read fine-print.
		- Figure 4b: This is a figure that would be better suited for a poster, which should present distilled content and be readable at different distances.
 		- Figure 4c: This is a figure that would be best for a presentation, where it complements the content that you are describing verbally as you proceed through the talk.

There is something to learn about each figure, and each lesson is supplemented by the Figure Rubric included in the following section. The Figure Spectrum is previewed below:

<h2 align="center">Figure Assessment Rubric</h2>
 <details>

In the Figure Rubric, we highlight six key attributes to help assess figures for presentations, publications, and posters. The six attributes are:
- Scale & Resolution
- Units & Labels
- Colors
- Emphasis
- Ink:Content Ratio
- Accessibility

The rubric shows examples of each attribute done well and done poorly, as well as a few pointers to keep in mind.

In this workshop, we explain how to take a plot exported from <a href="https://github.com/nrokh/ScientificFigures/blob/3777608834b74cf38e7a80259ed103772b47934a/Inkscape101/coffeeCupPlotting.m">MATLAB</a> as an <a href="https://github.com/nrokh/ScientificFigures/blob/3777608834b74cf38e7a80259ed103772b47934a/Inkscape101/coffeePlot.svg">.svg</a>, import it into Inkscape, and revise it based on the six key attributes listed in the Figure Rubric. Time-permitting, we explain how to create simple vector graphics using a <a href="https://github.com/nrokh/ScientificFigures/blob/3777608834b74cf38e7a80259ed103772b47934a/Inkscape101/CoffeeCup.jpg">photograph</a> as a guide.
