## Scientific Figures Syllabus

Learning outcomes for this repository
- Participants will learn how to critically review their figures through a provided spectrum of figure development and a figure evaluation rubric.
- Participants will understand resources for helping with figure construction and key points for figure construction through a figure evaluation rubric.
- Participants will understand differences and key components in creating figures for publications, presentations (including Thesis Advisory Committee meetings), and posters. 


## Overview of Workshop Items and Handouts

This workshop will include several items and documents for you to utilize in your figure-making journal. In this repo, we will provide you with the following tools
- Spectrum of Figure Creation
- Figure Assessment Rubric
- SciFigs helpful Links and FAQs
- Inkscape 101



<h2 align="center">Spectrum of Figure Creation</h2>

<details>
	
The spectrum contains multiple figures to help scientists understand the levels and differences of the iterative process for creating scientific visualizations. The figures are arranged in a pattern with the following:
- Spectrum of Figure Creation
	- Figure 1: The worst figure you (hopefully) will ever see. 
	- Figure 2
	- Figure 3 
	- Figure 4
 - Figure 4a
 - Figure 4b
 - Figure 4c

For each of these figures, there are specific lessons from each, which are supplemented by the figure rubric included in the following section. The spectrum of figures is previewed below:
