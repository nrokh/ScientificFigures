## Overview of Workshop Items

This workshop will include several items and documents for you to utilize in your figure making journal. In this repo we will provide you with the following tools
- Spectrum of Figure Creation
- Figure Assessment Rubric
- Poster, Presentation, Publication Quick Links and FAQs
- Quick start guide to Inkscape and other Open-source figure tools
- Figure Accessibility Guide

All items in this workshop are open-source and follow the ten definitions of Open Source included on `https://opensource.org/osd/`

  <strong>TEMPEH</strong>: Given calibrated multi-view images (top: 4 of 16 views; contrast enhanced for visualization), TEMPEH directly infers 3D head meshes in dense semantic correspondence (bottom) in about 0.3 seconds. TEMPEH reconstructs heads with varying expressions (left) and head poses (right) for subjects unseen during training. Applied to multi-view video input, the frame-by-frame inferred meshes are temporally coherent, making them directly applicable to full-head performance-capture applications.

In the folder, we provided information on the spectrum of figure creation, including figures from 1 to 5.

You can do something equivalent with `conda` as well.
