## SciFig Learning Outcomes for Users

Learning outcomes for this repository
- Participants will learn how to critically review their figures using the provided spectrum of figure development and a figure evaluation rubric.
- Participants will understand resources for helping with figure construction and key points for figure construction using a figure evaluation rubric.
- Participants will understand differences and key components in creating figures for publications, presentations (including Thesis Advisory Committee meetings), and posters. 


## Overview of Workshop Items and Handouts

This workshop will include several items and documents for you to utilize in your figure-making journal. In this repo, we will provide you with the following tools
- [Spectrum of Figure Creation](https://github.com/nrokh/ScientificFigures/blob/main/README.md#spectrum-of-figure-creation)
- [Figure Assessment Rubric](https://github.com/nrokh/ScientificFigures/blob/main/README.md#spectrum-of-figure-creation)
- [SciFigs Helpful Links and FAQs](https://github.com/nrokh/ScientificFigures/blob/main/README.md#spectrum-of-figure-creation)
- [Inkscape 101](https://github.com/nrokh/ScientificFigures/blob/main/README.md#spectrum-of-figure-creation)
- Running your own workshop (coming soon...)



<h2 align="center">Spectrum of Figure Creation</h2>

<details>
	
The spectrum contains multiple figures to help scientists understand the iterative process for creating scientific visualizations. The figures are arranged in the following pattern:
- Spectrum of Figure Creation
	- Figure 1: The worst figure you (hopefully) will ever see. Nobody ever needs to see another figure like this one. 
	- Figure 2: The same data and the same plot type from Figure 1 are now reworked into a more professional version. 
	- Figure 3: After careful consideration of the _data_, this figure combines the two subplots from Figure 2 to create a comprehensive and easy-to-interpret view.
	- Figure 4: After careful consideration of the _plot type_, this series of figures represents the data using a plot type that matches the data type. 
		- Figure 4a: This is a figure that would be appropriate for a publication, where the reader has lots of time to engage, think, and read fine-print.
		- Figure 4b: This is a figure that would be better suited for a poster, which should present distilled content and be readable at different distances.
 		- Figure 4c: This is a figure that would be best for a presentation, where it complements the content that you are describing verbally as you proceed through the talk.

There is something to learn about each figure, and each lesson is supplemented by the figure rubric included in the following section. The spectrum of figures is previewed below:

<h2 align="center">Figure Assessment Rubric</h2>
 <details>
	 
  <summary>Details</summary>
In this folder, we highlight six key attributes to help assess figures for presentations, publications, and posters. The six attributes are:
	 - Scale & Resolution
	 - Units & Labels
	 - Colors
	 - Emphasis
	 - Ink:Content Ratio
	 - Accessibility

Many parts of this workshop reference a previous GitHub made by co-presenter NR: [FiguresDemo2022](https://github.com/nrokh/FiguresDemo2022). The QR code for the logo and this GitHub repo were made using the Python tutorial from sahil_rajput: [PythonQR](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-generate-qr-code-using-pyqrcode-module/). For the figure spectrum, we utilized a Kaggle data set: [Eurovision Song Contest scores 1975-2019](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datagraver/eurovision-song-contest-scores-19752019). Finally, we thank all of the authors and contributors to Inkscape who are listed [here](https://inkscape.org/credits/). 

The authors thank the International Max Planck Research School for Intelligent Systems, [IMPRS-IS](https://imprs.is.mpg.de/) for supporting NR and AKS. The authors thank Brooke Christensen for the contribution materials utilized in making these resources. Thanks to [Katherine J. Kuchenbecker](https://is.mpg.de/~kjk) for support and feedback.
