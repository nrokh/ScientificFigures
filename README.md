## Scientific Figures Syllabus

Learning outcomes for this repository
•	Participants will learn how to critically review their figures through a provided spectrum of figure development and a figure evaluation rubric. 
•	Participants will understand resources for helping with figure construction and key points for figure construction through a figure evaluation rubric. 
•	Participants will understand differences and key components in creating figures for publications, presentations (including TAC meetings), and posters.
