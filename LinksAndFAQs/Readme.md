### Poster FAQ

**What programs can I use to make a poster?**  
Many people use Microsoft PowerPoint, but you can also use Adobe Illustrator; however, this program is not free. Other free software includes Inkscape as well as BioRender for creating posters.

**How large should the poster be?**  
For presenting a poster at a conference, always check the conference website, as it should include specific guidelines for size and spacing of maximum/minimum poster size. This can then be set on your program for the length (L) and width (W) dimensions. 

**How do I design my poster?**  
There are several formatting guides for making a poster. We have included links to creating your poster. Additionally, there are YouTube guides and tutorials for posters. Finally, remember that your poster will likely be hung up without you there to present it, so it should be interpretable on its own as well.

### Presentation FAQ

**How long should a presentation be?**  
Most conferences list presentation time, which likely includes both the presentation and question time. If not, be sure to ask the organizers. Thesis presentations typically have a 1-hour time slot, where normally 15-20 minutes is reserved for questions. 

**How do I minimize technical issues?**  
A common issue is playing videos: using GIFs instead of video is more reliable, but they will be of a lower resolution. Always be ready to troubleshoot presentation vs. presenter view. 

**How do I avoid compatibility issues with Macs and Keynote?**  
Check the presentation room beforehand to make sure you have the right connection cable type, and always keep an extra converter with you. If presentations need to be uploaded beforehand, be sure you have a backup PowerPoint file, saved onto a USB drive.

## Publication Resources & FAQs

| Blog Post | [Hyperlink](https://nrokh.notion.site/things-you-should-know-before-writing-code-fc825c32eab0415889e955fc076974f1?pvs=4) | Tips for writing shareable, public code |

| Publication | [Hyperlink](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/15291006211051956) | Review of effective visualization techniques |

### Publication FAQ

**What are limits for size, number of figures, or color?**  
Check the journal’s author guidelines. For instance, if you are submitting a paper to Journal of The Royal Society Interface, there is an “[information for authors section](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/rsif/for-authors)” which provides information for size, format, etc. for figure files. Expectations may be different between review and publication.  

**How do I ensure figures are not blurry in print?**  
There are two ways to ensure this. Always work in lossless formats. Additionally, when you receive your proofs for the publication, make sure you print it out and double-check the resolution in actual print. 

**Do Supplemental figures need to look good?**  
Many publications have strict page length requirements, which means there will be a large Supplemental section. Ensure that you are—at least—creating figures that are interpretable, legible, clear, and cohesive, so that all readers are able to interpret your work.

### Accessibility FAQ

**Why should I make my figures accessible?**  
There are a few reasons why this is important. Accessible PDFs enable optical character recognition (OCR) which reads out PDF content for individuals with vision impairment. Colorblindness and neurodivergent diagnoses are prevalent, and crafting figures that are as close to universally accessible is a core mission of science. It’s the right thing to do!

**Can I choose readable fonts for publications?**  
Unfortunately, journals typically enforce their own standardized fonts for the peer-reviewed and published versions. However, if you post your paper on a pre-print server, there are normally no font rules and therefore you can use more accessible fonts in those submissions.
